# Super Ultra Epic Mod
Have you ever had a terrible idea for a Minecraft mod? Yeah... us too. So we decided to compile them all into this mess! This mod is not meant to be balanced or make any iota of sense, but is certainly quite a lot of fun to mess around with.
## Features! (if you can call them that)
We don't have many right now, but we currently have the following implemented:

 - Frostwalker boats: Imagine if you could always have ice under your boat
 - Nether boats: Boats made out of the nether wood types.


Want to see your (hopefully dumb) idea in this mod? Feel free to [leave a feature request via our issue tracker](https://github.com/Team-Creative-Name/super-ultra-epic-mod/issues/new/choose) and if we like it enough it might get added!
